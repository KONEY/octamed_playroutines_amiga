# octamed_playroutines_amiga
MED playroutines in ASM. Refactored, fixed and extended by KONEY 2021
Based on Routines for programers utilising the OctaMED Program: http://m68k.aminet.net/package/dev/src/OctaMED-R

I managed to make this code work with Photon's mini Wrapper and I'm adding more things.

Any help would be appreciated :)
